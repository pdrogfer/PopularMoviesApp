# PopularMoviesApp

This is a nice app that displays recent movies, ordered by popularity or rating. There is a general view and a detail view,
which provides more information about each movie. This app fetches info from TheMovieDatabase.org. To make it work properly, 
you must first register at the website and get an API Key, then put your key in TMDB_API_KEY variable, in Utilities class.
Have fun!
